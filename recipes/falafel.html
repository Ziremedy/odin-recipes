         <p><strong>When I visited the middle east about a decade ago, falafel stands were on <em>every</em> street corner.</strong><br>
            Unfortunately, not everyone has that luxury, but if you follow this simple recipe, you too can enjoy authentic falafel anywhere in the world!

    <h4><u>Ingredients</u></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Dried chickpeas (1 Cup)</li>
        <li>Roughly chopped onion (1/2 Cup)</li>
        <li>Roughly chopped cilantro (1 Cup)</li>
        <li>Garlic (3 cloves)</li>
        <li>Cumin (1 tsp)</li>
        <li>Salt (1 tsp)</li>
        <li>Cardamom (1/2 tsp)</li>
        <li>Black pepper (1/4 tsp)</li>
        <li>Chickpea flour (2 tbsp)</li>
        <li>Baking soda (1/2 tsp)</li>
        <li>1 small green chile pepper</li>
        <li>Avocado oil for frying</li>
      </ul>

    <h4><u>Instructions</u></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Soak the dried chickpeas in water the night before, <strong>do not</strong> use canned. Make sure the water covers the chickpeas by about 3 inches, they will triple in size.</li>
        <li>Drain the chickpeas and then add them to your food processor, along with all the other Ingredients.</li>
        <li>Pule the food processor several times until the mixture looks like coarse sand.</li>
        <li>Transfer falafel mixture to bowl, cover and place in fridge for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Using an ice cream scoop, form the falafel into balls. If the mixture is too wet, you can add another tablespoon of chickpea flour. If it's too dry and crumbly, you can add a teaspoon or two of water or lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Once the falafel is formed, you can cook them by baking or deep frying. To deep fry the falafel, add about 3 inches of oil to a pot on medium heat. Heat the oil to 350F. Cook the falafel in batches (about 6-8 at a time) for 1-2 minutes or until golden.</li>
        <li>Check the color of the falafel and make sure they don't over cook. Remove them to a paper towel-lined plate once done.</li>
        <li>Falafel should be served immediately, while still warm and crispy on the outside. They're delicious served with tahini sauce or made into a wrap with pita bread and veggies. Enjoy.</li>

         <p><strong>This vegan hummus recipe is a traditional Lebanese classic.</strong><br>
             Hummus has become pretty mainstream in a lot of grocery stores around the world.
             It's essentially a Mediterranean spread that's made by blending chickpeas, tahini, lemon, garlic and salt.<br>
             Then, it's served with olive oil on top and traditionally eaten with pita bread or vegetables. 
             It's a healthy snack that you can eat as a dip or add to grain bowls, sandwiches or salads.</p></div>

<h4><u>Time: <i>20 minutes</i></u></h4>

<h4><u>Servings: <i>2</i></u></h4>

<h4><u>Ingredients</u></h4>
    <ul> 
    <li>Canned Chickpeas (3 cups)</li>
    <li>High quality Tahini (1/3 cup)</li>
    <li>Freshly squeezed Lemon juice (1 Lemon)</li>
    <li>Garlic (1 clove)</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li> 
    </ul>

<h4><u>Tips</u></h4>
    <ul> 
    <li><strong><u>Peel the chickpeas.</u></strong> For a smooth and creamy texture, it is recommended to peel the skin off the chickpeas. 
        To do this, simply simmer them for 20 minutes, this will ensure it is well cooked and easy to peel.</li><br>
    <li><strong><u>Use quality Tahini!</u></strong> I can't stress this enough, Tahini is basically the backbone in this dish.
        For the best results, use one made with 100% roasted sesame seeds.</li><br>
    <li><strong><u>Use ice for fluffier texture.</u></strong> Ice cubes help in whipping the hummus into a creamier, thicker texture.</li>
    </ul>

<h4><u>Instructions</u></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Simmer the can of chickpeas for about 20 minutes in plenty of water to help them soften.</li><br>
        <li>Cover the cooked chickpeas in hot water and add 1.5 teaspoon's of baking soda. Leave for 3 minutes. 
            Now take the chickpeas and rub them against each other under running water to remove the skins. Discard the skins and let the chickpeas cool completely before using.</li><br>
        <li>Dry the chickpeas well then add them to the food processor that's fitted with a blade. 
            Run the processor until the chickpeas turn into a smooth like paste.</li><br>
        <li>While the food processor is running, add tahini, lemon juice, pinch of salt, and 2-4 ice cubes as desired. Blend for about 4 minutes or so. If the consistency is too thick,
            run processor and slowly add a little hot water. Blend until you reach silky smooth consistency.</li><br>
        <li>Cover the hummus and refrigerate for at least one hour.</li><br>
        <li>All done! I recommend drizzling extra virgin olive oil on top for a more enhanced taste! Enjoy.</li>
